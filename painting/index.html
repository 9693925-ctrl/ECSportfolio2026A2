	  Painting has always been one of my most favorited interests, and I would love to share my journey on painting/drawing. 
<h3>Timelines</h3>
    <ul>
         <li>2016-I started to doodle on print paper, & my mom sent me to a multi media art class.</li> 
         <li>2018-This was when I slowly started to enjoy drawing/painting.</li>
         <li>2020-Traveled back to China to visit my family, started gaining interest in taking photography and painting them later.</li>
		 <li>2021-Started to take traditional Chinese watercolor painting classes</li>
		 <li>2023-Came back to the US, continued to practice art, most specifically focusing on watercolor.</li>
		 <li>2025-Still learning, but I often drive to the mountains/outdoors with my mom to go travel drawing.</li>
    </ul>
     <h3>Watercolor: Why do I Enjoy It?</h3>
	  In the timeline above, I have mentioned that my most favorite art media is watercolor painting, but is there a specific reason? When I first started to draw and learn about all the art mediums, I liked to draw with oil pastels, since they had a similar texture with crayons. But if you compare oil pastels and watercolor, you can tell that they are nothing alike! Then how did I manage to switch up on oil pastels? The main reason comes from my traditional Chinese watercolor class. Traditional Chinese watercolor is somewhat similar to water color, but it often uses grayscale to paint and uses a much thinner paper, and the water bloom effect is more dramatic.
